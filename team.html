                            <p>I've experienced my fair share of life challenges over the years. From losing my father to having four children, and suffering from postpartum depression - all throughout graduate school, I am very familiar with the challenges
                                life can bring. However, these challenges have also shown me the power of faith, resiliency, and perspective. With those three elements, I overcame (and continue to overcome) daily struggles. The truth is, we all suffer
                                hardships, and we all must learn the skills of coping with these if we truly want to live and to appreciate what life has to offer each day. I offer in-office sessions, Telemedicine, and outdoor therapy sessions (ask about
                                our walk and talk sessions). This combination can maximize results and utilize your time as productively as possible.<br></p>

                            <p>My name is Barbara Duenas and I am a Marriage and Family Therapy registered intern. I have worked within non-profit and for-profit organizations a like. I transitioned through various different professions to finally land what
                                I consider my calling. Having experienced some difficult experiences and losses of my own has prepared me to be a better therapist. I have studied different therapeutic techniques to better assist each type of client. Not
                                only are these therapeutic techniques evidenced based by science, but I myself have used these techniques in my own personal life to know they work. I have worked with clients in transition within their lives to have a
                                positive outcome. For example, mothers who recently had children, clients whom are recently diagnosed with a new medical condition, immigrants whom have left their country at a late age, people whom have been abandoned
                                by family, people whom have been betrayed by their partners, parents whom have lost their children and people with recent separations from a partner. I strive to aid individuals feel better about themselves to help their
                                relationships excel. I use psycho-education to help clients work on their interpersonal relationships with partners, friends or family members through strengthening their communication style. I encourage acceptance within
                                themselves and their current life circumstances. Some of the work is very intense and draining but getting to the core of where these emotions come from can have a very impacting change in your life.&nbsp; Individuals,
                                couples and family members live a healthier life based on the work they input with the materials I provide.&nbsp;<br></p>

                                During sessions, I am realistic and enjoy working collaboratively with clients to provide new insights and coping skills. I utilize a client-centered approach using cognitive behavioral techniques to address a myriad of
                                challenges, whether that is a new stage of life, personal losses, or experienced traumas. I have experience working with all ages and specialize working with teenagers and young adults. I am also currently training to assist
